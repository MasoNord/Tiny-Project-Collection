# Projects Collection

In this repostitory I'm going to store all my tiny projects which I made for learning purposes and didn't want to delegate a separate repository. For every project I'll create a separate folder with its own README file, which will contain an information about why's this project useful, what's new I learned while making it, what are new technologies I used to impelment it, etc. The main READMY file I'll keep as a roadmap with a short overview to each project
